## Flask Application Design for Health Monitoring System
**HTML Files:**
- **monitor.html**: This will be the main HTML page for the application. It will contain an HTML form for the user to enter their health data.
- **success.html**: This page will be displayed after the user successfully submits their health data. It will provide feedback and/or recommendations based on the input.
- **error.html**: This page will be displayed if the user encounters any errors while submitting their data. It will provide helpful error messages.

**Routes:**
- **/:** This route will render the **monitor.html** page, allowing the user to access the health data submission form.
- **/submit**: This route will handle the health data submission from the **monitor.html** page. It will collect the data and process it, generating feedback or recommendations. If the submission is successful, it will redirect to **success.html**. Otherwise, it will redirect to **error.html**.
